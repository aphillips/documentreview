<section id="introduction">
<h2><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Getting early review and feedback is important, especially reviews from those groups that have identified a document as a dependency and the <i class="term">horizontal groups</i>. It is also important to get review from other stakeholders including Web developers, technology providers and implementers not active in the Working Group, external groups and standards organizations working on related areas, etc.</p>
<p>In Process-2019, the focus is on getting evidence that wide review has occurred.</p>
</section>




<section id="how_to_get_horizontal_review">
<h2><a href="#how_to_get_horizontal_review">How to get horizontal review</a></h2>
<p>When you have published a First Public Working Draft, you should work through available "self-review" materials and request review of your results in at least the following areas. "Long enough*" before you request a transition to CR, you should do the same again, identifying substantive specification changes since the first review.
</p><p>The meaning of "Long enough*" depends on how many changes there are, how clearly you have explained them, and how much discussion is needed to resolve issues. Pointing to 14 concise points for a small spec means a short time if they are simple fixes, pointing to 900 diffs from commits and hoping people understand them in a 300 page spec means it will take a <strong>long</strong> time to get review, and potentially a long time to also discuss and agree on how to solve the issues. If you have effectively identified issues for review during development and received feedback on them, the review time will probably be shorter. Horizontal review groups sometimes get bogged down; planning in advance is useful.</p>

<section id="considerations_and_best_practices">
<h2><a href="#considerations_and_best_practices">Considerations and best practices</a></h2>
<p>Among the considerations and best practices, regardless of the <em>type of review</em> (early, thorough wide review, etc.) are:
</p>

 <section id="Who_to_ask_for_review">
 <h3>Who to ask for review?</h3>
<ul>
<li> Groups listed in the WG's charter</li>
<li> Groups jointly responsible for a particular document (if any)  (duh!)</li>
<li> All horizontal groups listed above.  If it appears that one of those is not relevant (and is not listed in your charter), talk to them informally to confirm that.</li>
<li> Other groups in your discretion, even if not in the WG charter: other W3C groups, external organizations and SSOs, implementers, application developers, etc.</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section id="When_should_review_be_requested">
<h3>When should review be requested?</h3>
<ul>
<li>For most documents, after a <em>First Public Working Draft</em> is published</li>
<li> Process-2019 requires wide review before a document is published at CR (Candidate Recommendation)</li>
<li> When a document is both reasonably stable and still flexible enough to allow changes where issues are identified</li>
<li> When new features are added after a document has already gotten wide review (perhaps requesting a review limited to the new features)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<p>Recognize that horizontal review groups may be resource limited and may only be able to do one review or may have difficulty scheduling your review quickly.  Give them as much time as you can, consistent with asking for review while it is still reasonable to change the technology to accommodate the issues they find.</p>
</section>





<section id="rfc_template">
<h2><a href="#rfc_template">Request for Comments (RfC) Template</a></h2>

<p>The Internationalization WG has a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-request/issues/new/choose">series of issue templates</a> that guide you through the information you need to provide when requesting a review.

<section id="working_with_horizontal_review_labels">
<h2><a href="#working_with_horizontal_review_labels">Working with Horizontal Review labels</a></h2>

<p>Applying these labels doesn't replace the need to schedule a review of your spec at an appropriate time. (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://w3c.github.io/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">How to Get Horizontal Review</a> above.) Horizontal groups participants can find <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://w3c.github.io/horizontal-issue-tracker/HOWTO">detailed process information here</a>.
</p>

<section id="Day-to-day_use_of_labels">
<h3>Day-to-day use of labels</h3>
<p>Apply the <span style="font-weight: bold; border:1px solid gray; border-radius:.5em; padding:2px 5px;">*-tracker</span> label in your own repository to draw a horizontal review group’s attention to an issue in one of your own repositories. Horizontal review groups may also apply the label if they are interested in tracking a particular issue.  Tooling will automatically notify the horizontal group that you attached the label.
</p><p>If you want some specific advice from the horizontal group, describe that request in the issue thread.
</p><p>Horizontal review groups may apply the <span style="font-weight: bold; border:1px solid gray; border-radius:.5em; padding:2px 5px;">*-needs-resolution</span> label to issues they expect to be resolved before the specification moves to a new maturity level. Working Groups must not remove or add this label (not even when you close your issue).
</p><p>If the horizontal group believes that an issue with a <i class="term">*-tracker</i> label needs to be resolved before a transition, they may apply a <i class="term">*-needs-resolution</i> label to the issue. Automatic tooling will later remove the <i class="term">*-tracker</i> label.
</p><p>At the end of a review, and before attempting to transition the spec, you should clarify that a resolution is described for all of the issues with a <i class="term">*-needs-resolution</i> label, and check that the horizontal group is aware of those resolutions. You don't have to do this for issues with the <i class="term">*-tracker</i> label. (The horizontal group was only tracking those issues, not expecting a particular resolution.)</p>
</section>



<section id="What_happens_to_unresolved_issues_marked_needs-resolution">
<h3>What happens to unresolved issues marked *-needs-resolution?</h3>
<p>As lead technical architect, the W3C Director is tasked (among many things) to assess consensus within W3C for architectural issues and to decide on the outcome of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#FormalObjection">Formal Objections</a>. When a horizontal issue gets flagged as *-needs-resolution and a Group chooses to request a new Maturity level despite the lack of consensus with the horizontal group, it is the task of the Director to assess the issue and the outcome of the request. A horizontal group MAY choose to elevate an horizontal issue as a Formal Objection to elevate further the importance of an issue per the W3C Process.
</p><p>In the case where an horizontal issue hasn’t been addressed and the document was allowed to move forward, it is recommended that the issue remains open in the horizontal group repository (it MAY get closed in the specification repository unless the Director requests otherwise). Some issues may take years to get resolved, but that doesn’t mean those should be forgotten.</p>

<p>The horizontal groups maintain repositories containing issues that track those raised in the WG repos. Key information about the current state of those tracker repositories is reflected in a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://w3c.github.io/horizontal-issue-tracker/index">set of tracker boards</a>, one per horizontal function.

<h2><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></h2>

<dl>
<dt>Q: Is <i class="term">security</i> and/or <i class="term">privacy</i> review mandatory before a <i class="term">First Public Working Draft</i> is published?</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A: Strictly speaking, no.  However, getting early review for documents with features that might have security and/or privacy implications is <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> - security and privacy issues can require significant changes in specs, and it helps to identify them early.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Q: Does a group need to prove its documents have had wide review before proceeding to CR?</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>A: Yes, since Process-2019.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Q: How does a group prove its documents have had wide review before proceeding to CR?</dt>
<dd><ul><li>A: See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2014Oct/0133.html">How to work with (experiment with) Wide Review</a> -SNZ</li>
<li>A: Keep a Disposition of Comments (DoC) Document that shows review comments and acknowledgements that have been received. It is the distribution of the reviewers that shows the review has been wide.-SNZ</li>
<li>A: Ask the W3C Team if your proposed approach is likely to meet the requirements. -SNZ</li></ul></dd>

<dt>Q: Is there such a thing as too many reviews?</dt>
<dd><ul><li>A: Not really</li></ul></dd>

<dt>Q: Is it possible to make too many requests for review?</dt>
<dd><ul><li> A: unfortunately, yes there is. Multiple requests for reviews can quickly result in a situation of diminishing returns. To help address this, subsequent review requests should clearly identify the exact differences between the last review and current review.</li>
<li> A: This is also the reason that the Process clearly suggests there should be (TR) Working Drafts published when there are "significant changes that would benefit from review beyond the Working Group", rather than every day or only twice in the life of a spec…</li>
<li> A: TR Working Drafts are also useful for reviews since they provide a dated snapshot which can be recovered when the review comments are being discussed. Trying to discuss review comments against a document which has changed out of all recognition can be a frustrating and inefficient experience.</li></ul></dd>
